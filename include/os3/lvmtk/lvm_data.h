 * Description:  This module defines the disk structures used by LVM,
 *               including that of the Master Boot Record (MBR) and
 *               Extended Boot Records (EBR).
 *
 * Notes: LVM Drive Letter Assignment Tables (DLA_Tables) appear on the
 *        last sector of each track containing a valid MBR or EBR.  Since
 *        partitions must be track aligned, any track containing an MBR or
 *        EBR will be almost all empty sectors.  We will grab the last
 *        of these empty sectors for our DLT_Tables.
